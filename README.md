# token-service
Full stack token service with spring boot and react

## Run all The Applications with single command:

- For Linux/Mac : 
```shell
./start.sh
```
- For Windows : 
```shell
start.bat
```

## TroubleShooting:
 - If you get `permission denied` when running the start script. Run the following command:
```shell
chmod +x start.sh
```
This will fix the permission issue. Now try running the `start` script again.
## Individual Project Run & Test:

Unit Tests and Projects can be run individually. Please follow each Project's readme to run the project & unit test individually.
